    ./buildmisc miscscene.slc
    ./buildbirdview birdviewmisc.slc
    ./buildmap map.slc
3. generate image data
   all tiles fetch from internet, GMapCacher(http://code.google.com/p/gmapcatcher/) is used for this purpose
   suppose the image data is in "cache" directory
   use a script 'yahoosat2smartiles.py' generate "imagelist" file, this file is used to generate db file with real image data.
   after generate a imagelist by 'yahoosat2smartiles.py', then type
   img2sql satelite.db imagelist
   this command will generate a database file satelite.db, this db file is specified in map.slc
4. run
   ./map.exe -f map.slc
img2sql satelite.db imagelist
